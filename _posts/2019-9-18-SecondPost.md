Greetings!

Mid-Autumn festival just passed. It's a big day of family reunion for Chinese. I did not buy any mooncakes when I visited Chinese supermarket in Richmond. Luckily my roommate gave me one mini-mooncake, a day after the festival, which was also a gift from her friend. Haha anyway I have something related to Mid-Autumn to have!! Yay!



Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
